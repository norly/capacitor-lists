Capacitor lists for retro devices
==================================

The part numbers listed in the tables are for [ordering at LCSC](https://www.lcsc.com/).

They are to be seen as examples - they seem to work for me,
but maybe there is a mistake lurking in the depths of analog
electronics that I'm not aware of. Use with caution!



NO WARRANTY
------------

NO WARRANTY OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED.

An effort has been made to document the original state of things,
as well as to search for replacement parts that are similar,
superior, or at least most likely sufficient in terms of capacity,
voltage, and size, but not in terms of any other parameters.

If your device stops working, catches fire, damages other devices,
or whatever else, don't blame me for it. This is just documents
how I maintained my own devices, not what is electronically the
best solution.
